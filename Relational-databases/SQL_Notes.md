### Introduction 

DataBase: A collection of tables that share connected data stored in a computer. 

#### Entity Relationship Diagrams

An entity relationship diagram (ERD) is a common way to view data in a database. Below is the ERD for the database we will use from Parch & Posey. These diagrams help you visualize the data you are analyzing including:


1. The names of the tables.
2. The columns in each table.
3. The way the tables work together.

You can think of each of the boxes below as a spreadsheet.

### What to Notice

In the Parch & Posey database there are five tables (essentially 5 spreadsheets):


1. web_events
2. accounts
3. orders
4. sales_reps
5. region

You can think of each of these tables as an individual spreadsheet. Then the columns in each spreadsheet are listed below the table name. For example, the region table has two columns: `id` and `name`. Alternatively the web_events table has four columns.

The "crow's foot" that connects the tables together shows us how the columns in one table relate to the columns in another table. In this first lesson, you will be learning the basics of how to work with SQL to interact with a single table. In the next lesson, you will learn more about why these connections are so important for working with SQL and relational databases.

### Tips: 

- it is common and best practice to capitalize all SQL commands, like SELECT and FROM, and keep everything else in your query lower case.
- It is common to use underscores and avoid spaces in column names.
- SQL queries ignore spaces, so you can add as many spaces and blank lines between code as you want, and the queries are the same. 
-  It is considered best practice to put a semicolon at the end of each statement, which also allows you to run multiple queries at once if your environment allows this.
- SELECT is first clause, LIMIT is last, 


----------

    Write a query that displays the order ID, account ID, and total dollar amount for all the orders,
    sorted first by the account ID (in ascending order), and then by the total dollar amount (in descending order).


    SELECT  id,account_id,total_amt_usd
    FROM orders
    ORDER BY account_id, total_amt_usd DESC

Note: switching account_id and total_amt_usd DESC returns different results.

| Statement | How to Use It               | Other Details                                         |
| --------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| SELECT    | SELECT Col1, Col2, ...      | Provide the columns you want                          |
| FROM      | FROM Table                  | Provide the table where the columns exist             |
| LIMIT     | LIMIT 10                    | Limits based number of rows returned                  |
| ORDER BY  | ORDER BY Col                | Orders table based on the column. Used with DESC.     |
| WHERE     | WHERE Col > 5               | A conditional statement to filter your results        |
| LIKE      | WHERE Col LIKE '%me%'       | Only pulls rows where column has 'me' within the text |
| IN        | WHERE Col IN ('Y', 'N')     | A filter for only rows with column of 'Y' or 'N'      |
| NOT       | WHERE Col NOT IN ('Y', 'N') | NOT is frequently used with LIKE and IN               |
| AND       | WHERE Col1 > 5 AND Col2 < 3 | Filter rows where two or more conditions must be true |
| OR        | WHERE Col1 > 5 OR Col2 < 3  | Filter rows where at least one condition must be true |
| BETWEEN   | WHERE Col BETWEEN 3 AND 5   | Often easier syntax than using an AND                 |
