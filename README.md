 ML Engineering = Machine learning systems design + Data Engineering + ML Ops 


- We present an iterative framework for designing real-world machine learning systems. 
-  We want to take a system level view of things and architect a solution based on  business requirements where the end goal of this framework is to build a system that is deployable, reliable, and scalable.
- Enterprise grade ML, a term mentioned in [a paper put forth by Microsoft](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00084), refers to ML applications where there is a high level of scrutiny for data handling, model fairness, user privacy, and debuggability. While toy problems that data scientists solve on laptops using a csv dataset could be intellectually challenging, they are not enterprise grade machine learning problems.
- In deployment (via containers or spark applications, for example), governance becomes paramount, especially in regulated environments. Data lineage, data versioning, model versioning, model explainability, model monitoring are all front and center.
- Examples of System Design/Data Engineering tasks include: 
  - Ingest data from a data source
  - Build and maintain a data warehouse 
  - create a data pipeline 
  - create an analytics table for a specific use case 
  - migrate data to cloud 
  - schedule and automate pipelines 
  - backfill data 
  - debug data quality issues 
  - optimize queries 
  - design a database

### Nice to have skills: 



| Task                                            | Description                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Containers**                                  | KubernetesDocker                                             |
| **Create** **Data Lakes with Spark**            | Data Wrangling with Spark ` Setting up Spark Cluster with AWS Debugging and Optimisation`Intro to data lakes ` |
| **Feature Store**                               | kind of an in-memory database such that at real time inference we have model features readily available |
| **Speeding up model prediction time**           | - Applying techniques such as pruning, quantization, or compression to reduce memory requirements - Running inference speed vs. accuracy experiments on a model |
| **Primer on distributed systems**               | ReplicationPartitioningTransactionsConsistency and Consensus |
| **Deal with constantly shifting distributions** | Data Drift :your real world dataset would not always have same distribution. For example the way a person shops in spring would be different than that of winter. So when you train a model on spring data set and deployed it you cant test it when winters come. So the data type is drifted away from normal and this is something to keep an eye Model Drift:now when your model is deployed and you start making predictions online (realtime) with passage of time due to data drift your model performance will de-grade and you would need to keep track of those changes. you would need to re train your model on latest dataset and then re-deploy it |
