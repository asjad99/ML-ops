### Introduction

A data warehouse is a copy of transaction data specifically structured for query and analysis.


- OLTP: online transactional processing
- OLAP: online analytical processing
- Data Warehouse is a system (including processes, technologies \& data representations) that enables us to support analytical processes

A data warehouse is a subject-oriented, integrated, nonvolatile, and time-variant collection of data in support of management's decisions. 

A data warehouse is a system that retrieves and consolidates data periodically from the source systems into a dimensional or normalized data store. It usually keeps years of history and is queried for business intelligence or other analytical activities. It is typically updated in batches, not every time a transaction happens in the source system.
